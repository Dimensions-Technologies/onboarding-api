# Onboarding API

The Onboarding API provides the tools necessary to automate the Customer onboarding process. Using a standards-based approach and recommended best practices, the REST-based API provides a simple yet powerful and secure way for Service Providers to be able to manage Customers and their Dimensions accounts.

Access to the Onboarding API can be obtained at Account (reseller) or Enterprise (service provider level). Depending on the level at which access is obtained, different features are available.
